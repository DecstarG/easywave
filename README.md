# easywave
A simple HTML/JavaScript waversurfer-js based audio player.

## What is the goal of this project?
This is an alternative to propietary audio players (like the ones built by default into most web-browsers like Chrome) and SoundCloud.
The intent of this project is for it to eventually be intergrated into the Kryptonite Browser as a fully featured web player.

## What can I do with this?
`easywave` is constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes. You could help expand the project by creating patches or contributing in other ways.
You could also use this to create your own fork of the project (just be mindful that this is under the MIT open-source license).
You could also try to use this to replace the proprietary SoundCloud player.

## Q/A

#### Why did you choose  that particular piece of sample audio?
Because it is something everyone should listen to when starting out.

#### When will `easywave` be finished?
Theoretically, never. Regardless of how much attention this repository gets, it will get updates for as long as Kryptonite is maintained.
